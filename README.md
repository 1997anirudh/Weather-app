# Weather-app

This is my first attempt at using Node.JS.

GitHub pages host only static HTML pages. No server side technology is supported, so Node. js applications won't run on GitHub pages.
I will eventauully upload this project on Heroku, once I make a few more corrections(such as UI and error handling).
